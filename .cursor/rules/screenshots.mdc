In order to build a screenshot correctly, you need to understand how this website is put together.
- Before building anything, make sure you study a few other sections inside src/components/sections. They will often demonstrate these important considerations:

## Design System & Components Available

This website is built using a strictly defined style system, as found in the app/(frontend)/css folder. All colors, sizing etc should come from here.
- Typography styles are predefined here. Never add typography weights, sizes, line heights etc inline. The whole site must follow the design system.
- Try not to use generic colors to match a screenshot design. Instead, use the brand colors inside [theme.css](mdc:src/app/(frontend)/css/theme.css). Be discerning about applying them in a tasteful, similar way to the screnshot. We want to convert the screenshot into a branded version for this website.
- Before you build anything, check what packages are available in [package.json](mdc:package.json). There will be ShadCN components to use for many reusable elements like buttons, accordions. Always use these. Always see what is available first.
- Never write icons as SVGs - lucide and react-icons are installed already. And also, double check in the components/icons folder to see if a branded version of what you want is available.
- You can use the cn() function from inside src/utilities/ui.ts.
