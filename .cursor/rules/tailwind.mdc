# Tailwind Configuration

- This website used Tailwind v4. This means that all config is handled inside css files.
- All tailwind code is located inside src/app/(frontend)/css
- globals.css is the entrypoint
- Since this is a website, not an app, we use a strict design system that is built into theme.css
- base.css is used to define the base styles of elements
- theme.css is where you will find the colors to be applied to all JSX youw write.
- if you need to create gradients or large amounts of classes that will be reused and belong on an element that won't become its own react component, create a custom class in components.css.
- typography.css is used to set all typography styling site-wide. Always write typography that is congruent with the design system.
- If you want to copy a screenshot or are asked to design a component or make a component responsive, NEVER apply your sizing directly to headings or paragraphs. This website has its typography defined by the style system inside app/(frontend)/css/... Never add styles for font weight, font size, line height, letter spacing to a component directly (unless they are specific overrides). Most designs should draw from the design system.
- Only use new classes for color changes etc - things that are unique to the current section.
- The tailwind-variants npm package is installed for complex components or things that need lots of variants/complex logic.
