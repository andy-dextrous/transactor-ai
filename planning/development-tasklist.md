# üéØ **TRANSACTOR 2.0 - DEVELOPMENT TASK LIST**

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Architecture:** Vertical-first, scalable foundation using Mastra + Supabase + Prisma

---

## üèóÔ∏è **DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY**

### **Vertical-First Approach**

This task list follows a **vertical-first development strategy** designed for maximum scalability and maintainability:

**Core Principle**: Build one complete user vertical (Buyer) with all necessary infrastructure, then replicate patterns for additional verticals rather than building horizontally across features.

**Why This Approach Works**:

- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Every new vertical reuses proven patterns
- ‚úÖ **Stability**: Core architecture is battle-tested before expansion
- ‚úÖ **Speed**: Subsequent verticals are 70% copy-paste with vertical-specific additions
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across the entire application
- ‚úÖ **Risk Reduction**: Unknown issues surface in Phase 1, not during scaling

**Phase Structure**:

- **Phase 1**: Buyer Vertical (Foundation) - Complete end-to-end experience
- **Phase 2**: Seller Vertical - Reuse patterns, add seller-specific tools
- **Phase 3**: Investor Vertical - Reuse patterns, add investment tools
- **Phase 4**: Professional Verticals - Reuse patterns, add professional workflows
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Features - Cross-vertical enhancements
- **Phase 6**: Scale & Polish - Performance, security, mobile

Each phase produces a **stable, deployable vertical** that can operate independently while sharing the same foundational architecture.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Phase 1 is Make-or-Break**

The buyer vertical serves as the **architectural foundation** for the entire application. Getting Phase 1 right is critical because:

- **70% of subsequent code** will be copied from Phase 1 patterns
- **All hybrid architecture patterns** (Mastra + Prisma) are established here
- **Agent orchestration model** must work perfectly before scaling
- **Chat-centric UX patterns** become the template for all verticals

### **Key Success Factors**

1. **Database First**: Complete Prisma schema before any other work
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Server actions must seamlessly bridge Mastra and Prisma
3. **Agent Alignment**: Agents must match PRD specifications exactly
4. **PRD Compliance**: All buyer user stories must work before Phase 2
5. **Pattern Documentation**: Every pattern must be documented for replication

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Week 1 Checkpoint**: Database schema and server actions must be complete
- **Week 2 Checkpoint**: Agent system must handle buyer conversations correctly
- **Week 3 Checkpoint**: Chat interface must display tool results inline
- **Week 4 Gate**: All PRD buyer stories must pass E2E tests

**If any checkpoint fails, STOP and fix before proceeding. Phase 1 quality determines entire project success.**

---

## üìä **CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**

### ‚úÖ **What's Complete**

- ‚úÖ **Project Setup**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, Radix components
- ‚úÖ **Mastra Foundation**: Core instance with basic agents
- ‚úÖ **Database Infrastructure**: Supabase + Prisma setup (schema empty)
- ‚úÖ **UI Library**: Complete Radix design system in `src/components/ui/`
- ‚úÖ **Property Components**: Basic cards and layouts
- ‚úÖ **Chat Foundation**: Mastra chat UI components

### üöß **What Needs Building - CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

- üöß **Prisma Schema**: **EMPTY** - No application data models (BLOCKS ALL FUNCTIONALITY)
- üöß **Agent System**: Current agents (weather, file, orchestrator) don't match PRD requirements
- üöß **Route Structure**: Missing user journey routes - no onboarding or dashboard
- üöß **Server Actions**: No Mastra/Prisma bridge - hybrid architecture not implemented
- üöß **Dashboard**: No contextual panels - chat interface incomplete
- üöß **Vertical Tools**: No role-specific functionality - buyer tools missing
- üöß **Document Processing**: No auto-extraction capabilities (SYS-03, SYS-04 requirements)
- üöß **Financial Tools**: No mortgage calculator, affordability checker, or grant eligibility
- üöß **Property Integration**: No property search or valuation API connections

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**

**Week 1 is CRITICAL** - All subsequent work depends on:

1. **Complete Prisma schema** with all models and relationships
2. **Hybrid server actions** bridging Mastra and Prisma
3. **Agent system redesign** to match PRD specifications
4. **Route foundation** supporting chat-centric UX

## üîÑ **SCALABILITY STRATEGY**

### **Pattern Replication**

Each vertical follows these established patterns:

1. **Agent Creation**: Copy agent structure, modify tools/instructions
2. **Route Addition**: Copy route patterns, modify role-specific content
3. **Component Extension**: Copy UI patterns, modify role-specific displays
4. **Workflow Replication**: Copy workflow structure, modify role-specific steps
5. **Testing Template**: Copy test patterns, modify role-specific scenarios

### **Shared Infrastructure**

All verticals share:

- ‚úÖ Database schema and relationships
- ‚úÖ Server action patterns
- ‚úÖ Chat interface foundation
- ‚úÖ Real-time update system
- ‚úÖ Authentication and authorization
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

This approach ensures **70% code reuse** for each new vertical while maintaining consistency and reducing development time exponentially.
